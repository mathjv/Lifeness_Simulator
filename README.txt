Here's the oficial simulator for everyone who wants to add upgrades, ideas, models and anything you want:

Then I'll show here the instructions for starting code:

	1.- First of all, to starting program, make sure your PC have installed python language version: 3.12 + (PATH Option checked).
	2.- It is Optional, but I recommend to code in Visual Studio Code for more suitable.
	3.- Copy and paste the folder "Lifeness Project" to your windows/linux/mac disk "Usually is C:".
	4.- Go to "C:\Lifeness Project\lifeness_simulator\life" and create a virtual environment. (here for default is matth).
	5.- Then, Once time in the folder, open the "requierments_builder.bat" file and wait for it end.
	6.- Then, Go to C:\Lifeness Project\lifeness_simulator and open the shorcut or Go to C:\Lifeness Project\lifeness_simulator/life and
	    Open the "launch.bat" file and wait for the program init.
	7.- Finally, when the app is running, close it and go to visual code, Open a new workspace file and choose the file into this rute C:\Lifeness Project
	8.- ¡Enjoy to code!

Here's some main point:

1. The code needs to have comments. Make sure you can do it for more organization.
2. Make sure to test frequently.
3. Classes are important for the program cleaning.
4. Check frequently for bugs or errors into classes.
5. Make sure you're using the latest Life version for code.


					That's all. Thank u everyone and I hope you'll enjoy Life.
